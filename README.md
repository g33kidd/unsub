## Getting Started

Before starting your phoenix app, you need to set the Environment variables `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` and `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`. This can be found by going to the twitter developer console/app manager and create an app. Follow the directions and create those environment variables.

## Starting the Application

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
